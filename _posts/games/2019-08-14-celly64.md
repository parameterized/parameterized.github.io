Shoot and bomb your way through a regenerative environment to collect guarded keys and escape to the next level.

Celly64 is a game where you navigate through an environment generated by cellular automata searching for keys (guarded by enemies) to open the portal to the next level. It was developed for [#lowrezjam 2016](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016).
